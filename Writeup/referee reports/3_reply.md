We thank the referee for their third report, and also for taking the time to prepare it over the holiday season. We respond to their points in the order in which they appear. Again, unless otherwise specified, section and equation numbers will refer to those of the reviewed rather than updated manuscript.

1. Linewidths and degeneracies.

> The authors persist in claiming that 'linewidths are not physically
> relevant for the following discussion,' despite the fact that linewidths
> are crucial for deriving a relevant fit. This is clear from lines
> 312-316, which show that no fit can be derived with linewidths fitted on
> a per-mode basis.

> The authors have also shown that the fit does not
> converge when individual heights are left free. This means that authors
> had to significantly reduce the number of degrees of freedom, so that
> the fitting process could (artificially) divide single peaks in two
> modes: a quadrupolar component and a radial or dipolar component.

> So, on this point, the authors need to properly account for the effect
> of degeneracy, and explicitly alert readers that their identification of
> the oscillation spectrum is possible, but uncertain. They also have to
> revise the uncertainties.

2. Differential vs. Solid-Body Rotation

> The authors persist in claiming a 'weak evidence for rotational shear.'
> All the rotation rates agree within 1-sigma (Figure 8), so that deriving
> any evidence of differential rotation, even weak, is not at all a
> significant finding. A 1-sigma difference (and certainty less than 1
> sigma, since sigma is underestimated) cannot support a detection. Nearly
> flat rotation (which is an interesting result) is as probable as
> differential rotation.

> Before publication, the authors need to remove claims of a weak
> detection of differential rotation or rotational shear.

3. Organisation

> The authors should move Section 2.4 toward the beginning of a (new) section "Discussion," for the sake of clarity.

In our last reply, we had explained why, in our view, §2.4 had to come before §3.1, since all following analysis relied on its evolutionary identification. However, we understand that the referee's suggestion may be motivated by the fact that all of the rest of §2 is concerned strictly with the gathering and first-order analysis of observational data. Conversely, §2.4 contains second-order analysis of the kind mostly also performed in §3. This being the case, rather than split it off into its own section altogether (which would be very short), we have decided instead to transfer it over to serve as the preamble of §3 (where none previously existed). Since this does not materially affect the content of the section, merely its location, we have opted not to bold out the text in the manuscript. We hope that the referee will find this to be an acceptable compromise.

> In Section 4.3, Equation 10 remains cryptic, with undefined terms.

Regarding Eq. 10, we point out that all terms appearing in it are defined. However, we had placed a few definitions several sentences after the equation itself, and it is possible that this distance is why the referee might have missed them. We now place these definitions immediately after the equation (and adjust the following text to avoid repetition), which we hope the referee will find to be clearer.

> Figure 12 is not analyzed in a clear way (not to mention inconsistent presentation: at line 1241, the vertical line indicates a notional rotation period of 100 d, but the caption indicates that this line corresponds to nu_max.

Regarding Fig. 12, we now make clear in the text that the vertical line indicates the currently observed nu_max, at which we impose in our simulations a rotation rate of 100 d. We have slightly rewritten our description of the figure in an effort to improve clarity.

> I reiterate my recommendation to split the paper in two parts, to allow
> for a clearer presentation of all elements introduced in Section 4. If
> not split off, a short paragraph introducing Section 4 should be added.

Since we still feel that the material presented in Section 4 remains insufficient for a standalone paper, we have instead taken up the referee's suggestion of writing up a substantial introductory paragraph for it, rather than opening with §4.1 without preamble.
