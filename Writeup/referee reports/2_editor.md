We find it strange that this referee engages in similar behaviour to that which you may recall from the referee for Saunders, Ong, & Basu 2023 (AAS40494). For instance, there are certain stylistic preferences, like the division convention for displaying units in table and axis labels, that both have highlighted and strongly insisted against (to the extent of characterising it as being outright incorrect). Additionally, we observe that an entire section has been recommended for deletion without clear explanation, as in that case. Our requests for clarification also remain unaddressed, as with that referee. Finally, both have now cast aspersions on our scientific integrity without substantiation. Are they, by any chance, the same person?

It's difficult for us to reconcile all this with this referee's claim to be providing constructive feedback. We have on our part tried our best to engage constructively, and have written a reply to the referee's report as we would normally have done; however, if it's at all possible, and if you think it suitable, we would like to request a second referee if further rounds of review will be required.
