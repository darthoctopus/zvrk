We must register our disappointment that this referee engages in the same pattern of obstructive behaviour as you may recall from the referee for Saunders, Ong, & Basu 2023 (AAS40494). Aside from some highly idiosyncratic requests which are not relevant to the content of both papers (e.g. insisting on not using the division convention for displaying units in table and axis labels), both referees recommend wholesale deletion of entire sections containing the main astrophysical discussion; have not engaged materially with our replies; have ignored requests for clarification; and have cast aspersions on our scientific integrity without substantiation. This is difficult for us to reconcile with this referee's claim to be providing constructive feedback. Now, as then, we will submit a second response back to the referee. However, if this unhelpful behaviour continues, we will request a second referee at that point.
