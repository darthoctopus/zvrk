# Lithium Signatures of an Engulfment (MSF)

If we believe the 3.3 dex engulfment signature, the presence of enhanced lithium in the star supports the hypothesis that a massive companion was engulfed and chemically mixed into the convective envelope of the star. However, this value is well above the 2.25 dex value that I'd expect for the ingestion of a 16 MJ companion (as inferred by Alex Stephan). I can put error bars on that value by performing an MCMC analysis of A(Li) resulting from engulfment across the expected companion mass range and baseline variance range for our system for a more quantitative approach. Given the proposed meteoritic lithium signature, I think it is possible that the star may also be self-enriched, as a result of the CF process paired with rotationally-driven chemical transport.
