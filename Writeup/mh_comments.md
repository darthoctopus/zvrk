- I'm leaning on extending Figure 1 to include a comparison with a luminous giant from the Yu+ 2020 catalogue. Also not limited to only the echelle. It would be nice to see the raw spectrum itself.


I omitted the following:

- Red clump stars are known to yield much higher values of both \Dnu\ and \numax\ than we have measured from Zvrk. Conversely, its \Dnu\ and \numax\ are too high, and thus it is not evolved enough, to be an asymptotic giant branch star. The measured values of these quantities instead strongly favour classification of Zvrk as a first-ascent red giant.


I don't think it's a convincing reason, whereas the other two in the list pretty much explains all we needed to say.



- While our putative identification of the quadrupole modes is unfortunate from the perspective of fitting the rotational splittings (as the quadrupole-mode triplets straddle both the dipole and radial modes), this identification of the quadrupole modes is required for general consistency with the values of $r_{02}$ typically returned from stellar models with comparable $\Dnu$ [e.g. @white_calculating_2011].


What does it mean for the identification to be unfortunate?


- Perhaps a citation to the form of the ansatz model (Equation 2) might be useful.

- Is it essential to show Figure 3 here rather than in an Appendix? It think a table summarizing the posterior distribution in the main text might be more apt. The Figure could alo use larger axis labels, they're so fine (not in a good way)!
