We find it strange that this referee engages in the same pattern of behaviour as you may recall from the referee for Saunders, Ong, & Basu 2023 (AAS40494). Specifically, aside from some highly idiosyncratic requests which are not relevant to the content of both papers (e.g. insisting on not using the division convention for displaying units in table and axis labels), both referees recommend wholesale deletion of entire sections without engaging with their content; do not engage materially with our replies; ignore our requests for clarification; and cast aspersions on our scientific integrity without substantiation. Is this, by any chance, the same person?

It's difficult for us to reconcile all this with this referee's claim to be providing constructive feedback. Now, as then, we will submit a second response back to the referee. However, we may request a second referee if a third round is required.
