We report the discovery of a rapidly-rotating red giant ($P_\text{rot} \sim 98\ \mathrm{d}$) observed with TESS in its Southern Continuous Viewing Zone. The rotation rate of this red giant is independently verified by the use of p-mode asteroseismology, strong perodicity in TESS and ASAS-SN photometry, and multiple measurements of spectroscopic rotational broadening. A two-component fit to APOGEE spectra indicates a spot coverage fraction consistent with the amplitude of the photometric rotational signal; modulations in this amplitude over time suggest the rapid evolution of this spot morphology, and therefore enhanced magnetic activity. We further develop and deploy new asteroseismic techniques to characterise radial differential rotation in its convective envelope. In particular we find significant evidence for rotational shear, although the sense of this shear is degenerate with the location of the shear layer. However, we also find that the stellar surface is most likely rotating faster than its interior. Such a high surface rotation rate is categorically incompatible with even the most physically permissive models of angular-momentum transport in single-star evolution. Moreover, spectroscopic abundance estimates also indicate an unusually high surface lithium abundance. Taken together, all of these suggest an ingestion scenario for the formation of this rotational configuration.
