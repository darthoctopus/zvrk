The claimed evolution of the photometric rotational signal where the TESS Cycle 1 has a 96-day period, and that of Cycle 3 at 93 days seems a bit of a hard sell, especially given the uncertainties in the period measurements.

One suggestion to make it more convincing would be to fit a GP and see if the interpretation holds...


APOKASC3 evolutionary states don't come only from me, but from an ensemble of classifications. Easier to just say you pulled the first ascent classification from the APOKASC3 catalog itself.
