\title{Gasing Pangkah I: Asteroseismology and Preliminary Characterisation \\ of a Rapidly-Rotating Red Giant in the TESS SCVZ}
\input{preamble}
\begin{abstract}
We report the discovery and characterisation TIC\ 350842552 (``Zvrk''), a standalone rapidly-rotating red giant ($P_\text{rot} \sim 99\ \mathrm{d}$) observed by TESS in its Southern Continuous Viewing Zone. The star's fast surface rotation is independently verified by the use of p-mode asteroseismology, strong periodicity in TESS and ASAS-SN photometry, and measurements of spectroscopic rotational broadening. A two-component fit to APOGEE spectra indicates a coverage fraction of these surface features consistent with the amplitude of the photometric rotational signal; variations in the amplitude of its photometric modulations over time suggest the evolution of its surface morphology, and therefore enhanced magnetic activity. We further develop and deploy new asteroseismic techniques to characterise radial differential rotation, and find strong evidence for rotational shear within Zvrk's convective envelope. This feature, in combination with such a high surface rotation rate, is categorically incompatible with even the most physically permissive models of angular-momentum transport in single-star evolution. Spectroscopic abundance estimates also indicate a near-meteoritic lithium abundance, among other chemical anomalies. Taken together, all of these suggest an ingestion scenario for the formation of this rotational configuration, various models for which we examine in detail. Such ingestion events represent an alternative mechanism by which the envelopes of post-main-sequence stars may spin up, as seen in the \textit{Kepler} sample, in conjunction with various existing hypotheses for outward angular momentum transport.

# Introduction

Single-star evolution predicts the development of radial differential rotation during a star's first ascent up the red giant branch, in the sense of there being a faster-rotating radiative core than convective envelope. While seismic rotational measurements with evolved stars indicate that subgiant convective envelopes rotate faster than strict angular momentum conservation would suggest [e.g. @mosser_spin_2012;@triana_internal_2017;@deheuvels_seismic_2020], envelope rotation rates nonetheless are predicted to further decrease dramatically as red giants expand, making them challenging to measure for more evolved red giants at higher luminosity. Indeed, many existing techniques for seismic rotation measurements in these evolved stars, which operationalise the phenomenology of the gravitoacoustic mixed modes exhibited by red giants, assume a priori that the rotation of the stellar envelope may be ignored [e.g. @gehan_core_2018;@mosser_period_2018]. In the regime of (relatively) strong coupling between the interior g-mode cavity to the exterior p-mode cavity, this simplifying assumption has enabled the measurement of core rotation rates in red giants of intermediate luminosity in the *Kepler* sample en masse, at the expense of sacrificing information about the surface rotation of these stars. Since the surfaces of red giants are not expected to rotate in any significant fashion, such a loss of sensitivity is ordinarily considered acceptable.

Contrary to this expectation, a small fraction of the *Kepler* red giant sample does exhibit nontrivial photometric variability, attributable to surface features rotating into and out of view [e.g. @tayar_rapid_2015;@ceillier_surface_2017]. Rotation rates as high as these are not generally compatible with standard descriptions of angular momentum transport constructed to describe less evolved stars [@aerts_angular_2019;@fuller_slowing_2019], and indicate that these rapidly-rotating red giants (RRRGs) may have passed through evolutionary scenarios quite unlike the standard picture of single-star evolution [e.g. @massarotti_rotational_2008;@carlberg_frequency_2011]. In particular, such stars are thought possibly to have been spun up as a result of binary interactions [e.g. @tayar_rapid_2015;@casey_tidal_2019] or engulfment events [@lau_hot_2022;@oconnor_giant_2023]. The latter would be associated with overabundance in light elements such as lithium in the envelopes of first ascent red giants [e.g. @aguileragomez_lithium_2016a;@aguileragomez_lithium_2016b;@soaresfurtado_lithium_2021], and may provide insight into the evolution of late-stage planetary systems [e.g. @de_infrared_2023].

Similarly to main-sequence stars, we expect that asteroseismic constraints on surface rotation in evolved stars will be provided by their exterior p-mode cavity, rather than through the interior g-modes that are typically measured. While coupling between the two mode cavities prevents direct measurement of these pure p-mode frequencies, the strength of this coupling in first-ascent red giants decreases dramatically with evolution [e.g. @farnir_eggmimosa_2021;@jiang_evolution_2022;@ong_rotation_2]. The frequencies of p-dominated mixed modes therefore become observationally indistinguishable from those of the pure p-modes underlying them in higher-luminosity RRRGs, which are in any case mostly convective by spatial extent. Although traditional computational methods for mixed-mode asteroseismology --- and in particular those which relate mode frequencies to interior structure --- have been very expensive to apply to these most highly luminous red giants [@jcd_aarhus_2020], recent theoretical developments now permit the numerical analysis of red-giant p-modes to be performed in a likewise decoupled fashion from the interior g-mode cavity, thereby circumventing these computational difficulties [@ball_surface_2018;@ong_semianalytic_2020].

However, RRRGs are frequently observed to have suppressed oscillations, making asteroseismic characterisation of them challenging. This suppression is attributed to tidal synchronisation with a close companion [@gaulme_active_2020]. Conversely, the overwhelming majority of evolved fast rotators which do exhibit pulsations do not have detectable orbital companions (ibid.), rendering their rotation all the more difficult to explain.

We thus report the contemporaneous detection and characterisation of rotational and asteroseismic signals in TIC\ 350842552 (which we will refer to informally as "Zvrk"[^zvrk] in the remainder of this work, for brevity), a highly evolved and most likely standalone RRRG. Asteroseismology (from the NASA TESS mission), direct photometry (both from TESS, and separately with the ground-based ASAS-SN network), and spectroscopy (various ground-based spectrographs) all independently confirm the presence of a 100-day photometric rotational modulation. Zvrk's spectroscopic chemical abundances also exhibit peculiarities that are difficult to explain by way of single-star evolutionary modelling. In addition, Zvrk is far more evolved than almost the entire *Kepler* sample of RRRGs [@ceillier_surface_2017], such that all of its observed modes may be well approximated as being pure p-modes. We thus bring to bear new analytic developments in the interpretation of rotational signatures derived from p-mode oscillations in this red giant. Rather than characterising a two-zone core-vs-envelope rotational contrast as is typically examined in less evolved red giants, we find instead evidence here for radial differential rotation situated entirely within Zvrk's convective envelope. Zvrk's high rotation rate, rotational shear, and anomalous chemical abundances are highly suggestive of an ingestion scenario for its formation, on which we place preliminary constraints. We conclude with some discussion about the astrophysical significance of this finding, methodological implications of the techniques that were developed for this work, and suggestions for future work.

# Observational Characterisation

Zvrk was initially flagged for asteroseismic analysis as part of an ongoing large-scale search for unusual oscillation signatures corresponding to chemical peculiarities, in particular high lithium abundance. For this purpose, an overlapping sample of stars with both preliminary GALAH DR4 lithium abundance estimates, and TESS coverage in the Southern continuous viewing zone (CVZ), was constructed (Montet et al., in prep). Targets in this list were subjected to preliminary asteroseismic analysis, to constrain the global p-mode asteroseismic parameters $\Dnu$ and $\numax$. This was done using the 2D autocorrelation function technique [2DACF: @viani_dnu_2019], applied to the SPOC light curves from the first two Southern CVZ campaigns in TESS Cycles 1 and 3. For Zvrk in particular, this procedure yielded $\Dnu = (1.23 \pm 0.01)\ \mathrm{\mu Hz}; \numax = (7.5 \pm 0.3)\ \mathrm{\mu Hz}$.

Among this sample, Zvrk stood out because of an unusually large surface lithium abundance ($\mathrm{A(Li)} \sim 3.2$; cf. \autoref{sec:spec}). Also unusually for a red giant, it was observed by TESS at two-minute cadence: in Cycle 1 (Sectors 1-13), Cycle 3 (Sectors 27-39), and the ongoing Cycle 5. This allowed our analysis to be performed with respect to the publicly available presearch data conditioning simple aperture photometry (PDCSAP) lightcurves instead. Moreover, its power spectrum exhibits unusual features, whose structure departs significantly from that seen in similarly evolved red giants [e.g. @stello_nonradial_2014;@yu_luminous_2020], which defeated preliminary attempts at p-mode identification. To illustrate this, we show in \cref{fig:echelle-bare} the echelle power diagram obtained using the 2DACF value of $\Dnu =  1.23\ \mu$Hz. Of particular note is a double-ridged feature marked out with the white bounding box, whose significance we explain below.

![Échelle power diagram of Zvrk from PDCSAP lightcurves, using a nominal value of $\Dnu = 1.23\ \mu$Hz. The white dashed rectangle shows a double-ridge feature which, naively applying the asymptotic relation \cref{eq:asymptotic}, one would expect to identify as being radial and quadrupole modes. Under this identification, the remaining peaks must be identified as dipole mixed modes, as they do not appear to obey the same asymptotic relation. \label{fig:echelle-bare}](echelle_bare.png)

## Detailed Asteroseismology

\label{sec:mcmc}

To proceed with further asteroseismic analysis, identifications for the integer indices $n_p, \ell, m$ must be assigned to such mode frequencies as are derived from the observed power spectrum. Morphologically, these double ridges on its frequency echelle diagram, \cref{fig:echelle-bare}, are evocative of those of other p-mode oscillators, as previously observed en masse with *Kepler* and TESS, and suggest identification as being modes of low, even degree ($\ell = 0, 2$), which are known in p-mode oscillators to form double ridges of this kind as a result of the p-mode asymptotic eigenvalue equation
\begin{equation}
\nu_{n_p\ell} \sim \Dnu\left(n_p + {\ell \over 2} + \epsilon_p\right) + {\ell(\ell+1)}{\delta\nu_{02}\over 6} + \mathcal{O}(1/\nu),\label{eq:asymptotic}
\end{equation} in the absence of rotation. Here $\Delta\nu$ and $\delta\nu_{02}$ are the large and small frequency separations from the standard phenomenological description of p-mode asteroseismology, and $\epsilon_p$ is a slowly-varying phase function. The remainder of the oscillation power would, under this putative identification, be attributed to oscillations of dipole modes, which are known in other red giants to be disrupted by mode mixing with an interior g-mode cavity, producing a complex forest of gravitoacoustic mixed modes. Visually, this morphology strongly resembles that seen in core-helium-burning stars, where the coupling between the interior g-mode and exterior p-mode cavities is known to be strong. Indeed, this is the mode identification also arrived at by the use of existing "data-driven" automated methods, trained on the *Kepler* sample of oscillating red giants [e.g. PBJam: @pbjam].

    \caption{Posterior distributions for quantities returned from nested-sampling peakbagging procedure. The main figure, in the lower left, shows the joint posterior distribution for quantities entering into \cref{eq:model} that are pooled between modes. In particular, we see that there is mild correlation between some properties of our background model (labeled "Granulation" here), but the quantities of asteroseismic relevance are constrained to be statistically independent of each other, aside from a very mild correlation between the axial inclinations $i$, the pooled linewidths $\Gamma$, and the rotational splittings $\delta\nu_{\text{rot},\ell}$. The dipole-mode rotational splitting can be seen to be smaller than that of the quadrupole modes. The inset figure, shown in the upper right, shows the joint distribution for quantities associated with the dipole mode closest to $\numax$ (i.e. $n_p = 5, \ell = 1$), where again the notional nonrotating frequency $\nu$ is constrained independently from the mode amplitude. The joint distribution between modes also indicates that the mode frequencies for all modes are independent of each other (although that corner plot is too large to fit on a single page). The mode frequencies derived from nested sampling in this fashion, and their uncertainties, are reported in \cref{tab:peakbag}.}
    \label{fig:shared}
\end{figure*}

However, such an identification would be in significant tension with other known properties of stochastically-excited red giant oscillations. In particular:

- Red clump stars are known to yield much higher values of both \Dnu\ and \numax\ than we have measured from Zvrk. Conversely, its \Dnu\ and \numax\ are too high, and thus it is not evolved enough, to be an asymptotic giant branch star. The measured values of these quantities instead strongly favour classification of Zvrk as a first-ascent red giant.
- This mode identification would imply a radial p-mode phase offset of $\epsilon_p \sim 0.2$. However, the value of $\epsilon_p$ for radial modes in first-ascent red giants follows an extremely tight and robust relation with \Dnu, both in theoretical studies of stellar models [e.g. @white_calculating_2011;@ong_structural_2019], as well as in existing large-scale characterisation of the *Kepler* sample [e.g. @mosser_universal_2011;@yu_luminous_2020]. Thus, such a value of $\epsilon_p$ would be in very significant tension with the value of $0.7$ implied by the *Kepler* sample for red giants close to our nominal value of $\Dnu = 1.23\ \mathrm{\mu Hz}$.
- Both single-star stellar modelling [e.g. @deheuvels_seismic_2022] and observational measurements [e.g. @mosser_mixed_2014] of gravitoacoustic mixed modes in the *Kepler* sample also indicate that $\Delta\Pi_1$, the dipole-mode period spacing associated with the interior g-mode cavity, lies in a narrow band of allowed values with \Dnu\ for first-ascent red giants. At this value of \Dnu, $\Delta\Pi_1$ would also be far too small, and the mixed-mode coupling strength be too weak, to cause significant departures in the frequencies of the observed dipole modes from those of simple p-modes.

We show instead in \cref{fig:asteroseismology}a our proposed alternative mode identification, which takes into account all of the above constraints from the *Kepler* field. By necessity, our radial modes are anchored by $\epsilon_p$ measurements from the *Kepler* field.  To illustrate this, we show the average value of this quantity for all stars within $0.5\ \mu$Hz of $\Dnu$ to Zvrk in the catalogue of @yu_luminous_2020, and their standard deviation, using the white dashed line and red shaded interval, respectively.

In the presence of rotation, each mode at degree $\ell$ and radial order $n_p$ splits into a $(2\ell+1)$-tuplet of peaks in the power spectrum, with the distribution of observed power between peaks being determined by the inclination of the stellar rotational axis [@pesnell_observable_1985;@gizon_inclination_2003]. Rather than being modes of even degree, we instead identify the double ridge as being rotationally-split doublets of dipole ($\ell = 1$)  modes, viewed close to equator-on. In such an equator-on configuration, a mode of degree $\ell$ yields an $(\ell+1)$-tuplet; our identification of the quadrupole modes must then be constrained by having to explain the remaining peaks using rotationally-split triplets. While our putative identification of the quadrupole modes is unfortunate from the perspective of fitting the rotational splittings (as the quadrupole-mode triplets straddle both the dipole and radial modes), this identification of the quadrupole modes is required for general consistency with the values of $r_{02}$ typically returned from stellar models with comparable $\Dnu$ [e.g. @white_calculating_2011]. Moreover, in keeping with the star's evolved state, all of these modes are proposed to be essentially decoupled from the interior g-mode cavity.

Since g-mode mixing is not an observational concern, we may directly repurpose existing techniques for the derivation of p-mode frequencies from power spectra --- peakbagging --- to this star. For this purpose, we fit an ansatz model in the form
\begin{equation}
    f(\nu) = \sum_i \sum_{m=-{\ell_i}}^{\ell_i}{H_i r(m, \ell_i, i_\star) \over 1 + (\nu_i + m \delta\nu_i - \nu)^2/\Gamma_i^2} + \mathrm{BG}(\nu)\label{eq:model}
\end{equation}
directly to the power spectrum. The asteroseismic component of this power spectral model can be seen to be a sum of Lorentzians parameterised by the nonrotating frequencies $\nu_i$, the mode heights $H_i$, the inverse mode lifetimes $\Gamma_i$, the rotational multiplet splittings $\delta\nu_i$, as well as the inclination $i_\star$ of the rotational axis (through the visibility ratios $r$ of each multiplet component). In addition to this, we choose to describe our background model with a combination of a single Harvey profile and a white-noise term. 

We seek to infer posterior distributions of all of these parameters in a Bayesian sense, which necessitates the imposition of prior distributions. We place flat priors on each $\nu_i$ in windows $0.2\ \mu$Hz wide, centered on each of the manually identified values shown in \cref{fig:asteroseismology}a; a flat prior on $\mu = \cos i_\star$ for isotropy; flat priors on the logarithms of the mode lifetimes, heights, and all parameters of our noise model; and flat priors on the widths of the rotational splittings. For our main analysis in this section we moreover pool the rotational splittings of the dipole and quadrupole modes separately, assigning either $\delta\nu_{\text{rot}, \ell=1}$ or $\delta\nu_{\text{rot}, \ell=2}$ to each nonradial mode depending on its degree $\ell_i$. Additionally, we performed this exercise with and without pooling of the linewidths $\Gamma_i$. However, we found that, when linewidths were fitted on a per-mode basis, the posterior distributions of the linewidths for modes with low signal-to-noise ratios were very poorly constrained, and therefore permitted to take on unphysically large values at low amplitudes given our uninformative prior. In any case, the linewidths, which describe the damping rates of the modes, are not physically relevant for our following discussion, and their dependence on the mode frequency is weak at the low frequencies that we consider here. As such, we restrict our attention to results derived with a single linewidth $\Gamma$ being fitted against all modes, to simplify our analysis.

Using this parameterisation, these priors, and the standard likelihood function for describing values of the power spectrum $P_j$ by the $\chi^2$ distribution with 2 degrees of freedom [@anderson_modeling_1990],
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}(\theta) \propto \exp \left[-\sum_j \left(\log f(\nu_j, \theta) + {P_j \over f(\nu_j, \theta)}\right)\right],\label{eq:lnlike2dof}
\end{equation}
we use the nested-sampling Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, as implemented in the `dynesty` Python package, to infer the posterior distribution implied by the TESS data. In \cref{fig:asteroseismology}b, we show 100 draws from the posterior distribution overplotted on the power spectrum, with contributions to \cref{eq:model} at different degree $\ell$ indicated with different colours of curves. The averages of these samples are shown with a colour-separated echelle power diagram in \cref{fig:asteroseismology}c, for easier graphical comparison with our mode identification by hand.

The fitted model power spectra shown in \cref{fig:asteroseismology} can be seen to exhibit quite large rotational splitting, consistent with our initial hand-picked mode identification. We examine this more quantitatively in \cref{fig:shared}, where we show the joint posterior distributions for all pooled seismic quantities, as well as the parameters of our combined red- and white-noise background model. We report the medians and the widths of the $1\sigma$ credible regions of the posterior distributions for the fitted nonrotating ($m=0$) mode frequencies in \cref{tab:peakbag}. From our radial mode frequencies alone, we re-fit $\Delta\nu$ to yield $1.21 \pm 0.01\ \mu$Hz. For rotation in particular, we find that the averaged $\ell = 1$ and $\ell = 2$ rotational splittings, at $\delta\nu_{\text{rot}, 1} = 0.091 \pm 0.007\ \mu\text{Hz}$ and $\delta\nu_{\text{rot}, 2} = 0.104\pm0.007\ \mu\text{Hz}$, are both much larger than the pooled linewidth of $\Gamma = 0.07\pm0.01\ \mu\text{Hz}$. Thus, it is likely that neither our axial inclination constraint of $i_\star = {84 ^{+4}_{-5}} ^\circ$, nor our estimates of the rotational splittings themselves, are significantly affected by the systematic biases described in @kamiaka_reliability_2018 [see also @gehan_automated_2021]: Zvrk is indeed viewed close to equator-on, in keeping with our mode identification by hand. Finally, we note that the dipole and quadrupole rotational splittings are slightly different from each other; we will return to this in our more detailed analysis using numerical stellar modelling.

## TESS and ASAS-SN Photometry

\label{sec:photometry}

In addition to asteroseismology, we should in principle also be able to derive estimates of an overall surface rotation rate from photometry, assuming that Zvrk exhibits photometric rotational variability of a similar kind to that previously observed in rapidly-rotating *Kepler* red giants. However, the short-cadence PDC-SAP lightcurves from which our asteroseismic analysis above is derived have been aggressively detrended to eliminate long-term temporal variability. As a result of this detrending, rotational periods spanning multiple 27-day sectors may not be reliably determined directly from this data product, and indeed our attempts to do so were unsuccessful. The rotational frequencies obtained from our seismic analysis correspond to rotational periods of potentially up to 126 days (from our slower dipole-mode rotational frequency), thereby necessitating the use of alternative techniques.

Therefore, we instead construct our own custom aperture-photometry light curves, correcting for TESS instrumental systematics by applying the pixel-level decorrelation technique [PLD: @deming_spitzer_2015], as implemented in the `lightkurve` Python package, to the TESS target pixel files. While this suffices to recover slow variability within each TESS sector, the long rotational periods under consideration also require us to stitch TESS sectors together in a principled fashion. Again, since our asteroseismic analysis suggests rotational periods which are far longer than the duration of a single sector, we opt to do this stitching by naive linear extrapolation. Specifically, we fit a linear function to the last 5 days of each sector, and extrapolate the fitted function to evaluate it on the first 5 days of the next sector. We then normalise the next sector such that the median flux within its first 5 days is scaled to match the median of the extrapolated function at the sampled times. This procedure is repeated for each consecutive sector. We show the results of this procedure with the blue points in \cref{fig:photometry}. Note that this procedure relies on there not being gaps between sectors, and so the missing sector 36 in Cycle 3 results in sectors 37-39 not being stitched to the preceding sector 35. Nonetheless, a clear periodic variation can be seen to emerge in Cycle 1, all of whose 13 consecutive sectors are successfully treated with this procedure, with a period of roughly 100 days. Likewise, similar periodicity can be seen in the first 9 consecutive sectors of Cycle 3, albeit at reduced amplitude.

To confirm that these variations are not caused by other latent, unaccounted TESS instrumental systematics, or artificially and inadvertently introduced by these choices of detrending or stitching procedures, we also examine Zvrk through independent ground-based photometry. We do so by way of the ASAS-SN network of ground-based telescopes [@shappee_asassn_2014;@kochanek_asassn_2017;@hart_asassn_2023]. Since Zvrk is fairly bright ($M_V = 10.24$), this photometry had to be performed with custom apertures to account for detector saturation \remarkJO{Ben: need a good description of your custom aperture stuff}. While less precise (and more noisy), any periodic instrumental systematic perturbations which affect the ASAS-SN detectors operate on very different timescales from those afflicting TESS, and thus over longer timescales we may rely on ASAS-SN to anchor our absolute photometric normalisation. We compare in \cref{fig:photometry}a the normalised ASAS-SN V-band and g-band photometry with our TESS lightcurves, choosing to display each consecutive run of TESS sectors in such a way as to match the median normalisation of the contemporaneous ASAS-SN g-band data points, which as a whole are themselves shown median-normalised. The ASAS-SN V-band data have also been scaled to yield equivalent median normalisation over the overlap period where contemporaneous observations exist with g-band. 

We can see immediately that the independent ASAS-SN data exhibit periodicity contemporaneous with that shown in TESS Cycle 1, with visually indistinguishable phase and period, indicating that the periodicity that we claim to have observed with TESS is genuine, rather than a result of TESS-specific systematics. Furthermore, this periodicity can be seen to continue in the ASAS-SN data for at least two more rotational periods after the end of TESS Cycle 1 (i.e. after a BTJD of about 1690), suggesting relatively slow evolution of any surface morphology causing the rotational signal. Since this procedure appears to work well on Cycle 1, and since the properties of the instrument and 2-minute-cadence data are not appreciably modified in succeeding sectors, we feel confident in assessing the apparent periodicity in Cycle 3 to be also genuine (albeit lying below ASAS-SN's noise floor for robust characterisation). In the small period of overlap between TESS Cycle 1 and ASAS-SN V-band coverage, the temporal variations in the ASAS-SN data can also be seen to be apparently in phase with the TESS modulation signal.

Many techniques exist for the derivation of the period of this kind of quasiperiodic variability. For our analysis, we will rely on the standard Lomb-Scargle technique, since it allows us to combine multiple data sets with different temporal sampling characteristics, and has already been used extensively in the literature. We show in \cref{fig:photometry}b the normalised Lomb-Scargle periodograms for different subsets of the data shown in panel (a), and additionally a periodogram generated from the combined data set, shown with the thick red line. We can see that all of the data sets exhibit a large peak at a period of between 90 to 100 days. Interpreting the combined periodogram as being a log-likelihood function, we use the inverse curvature of this peak (or, equivalently, its half-width) as an estimate of the uncertainty on its location [@ivezic_statistics_2014;@vanderplas_understanding_2018], and in this fashion find it to be at $99 \pm 3$ days. The scatter in the location of this peak in the other periodograms shown is 2 days, which we adopt as an estimate of variability between our data sets. To estimate the systematic uncertainty owing to our choice of methodology, we also fit a Gaussian process using a quasiperiodic kernel against the ASAS-SN g-band data set, obtaining a periodicity of $104 \pm 7$ days. We adopt the discrepancy between the two techniques as an estimate of our systematic error. Thus, we report a rotation rate of $99 \pm 3 \text{(stat)} \pm 5 \text{(sys)}$ days.

The roughly 2-4% peak-to-peak amplitude of this variability can be seen to depend on the instrument measuring it. The larger amplitude of the modulation as observed by ASAS-SN compared to TESS reinforces an interpretation of this signal as originating from a rotational modulation. A fixed temperature contrast between cool surface features, such as spots or large-scale convective patterns [e.g. @paladini_large_2018], and the surrounding stellar photosphere, will yield a greater reduction in intensity compared to the rest of the disk when observed in a bluer bandpass than in a redder one, and ASAS-SN's V-band ($\lambda \sim 540\ \mathrm{nm}$) and g-band ($\lambda \sim 477\ \mathrm{nm}$) observations are indeed bluer than TESS ($\lambda \sim 787\ \mathrm{nm}$). If these features are indeed convective in origin, then we should expect them to evolve over the course of the convective turnover timescale. Alternatively, if they arise from near-surface magnetism like that seen in active main-sequence dwarfs, we should also expect their shapes and positions to change over many rotational periods. Either way, this will affect the properties of the observed photometric modulations. The shapes and sizes of such features will affect its amplitude, and their positions will, in the presence of latitudinal differential rotation, modify its apparent period.

The prominence of this photometric rotational signal and, to some extent, its period, do indeed appear to vary over time. The peak of the Lomb-Scargle periodogram for TESS Cycle 1 is located at a period of 96 days, and that of Cycle 3 at 93 days, suggesting some temporal variations in the putative rotational frequency. We investigate this with more detail in \cref{fig:photometry}c, which shows a frequency-time power diagram generated using the Lomb-Scargle wavelet power spectrum utility function of the ASAS-SN Sky Patrol client [@hart_asassn_2023], over which we mark out our nominal surface rotational period of 99 days with a horizontal line. The wavelet-transform power in different bandpasses is shown on this diagram in different colour channels. The normalisation with which each wavelet-transform power is displayed is chosen to saturate each colour channel by a factor of 1.5, to enhance the visibility of lower-amplitude features. The peaks of 100 days in our periodograms in panel (b) correspond to a horizontal band of power on this frequency-time power diagram. Heuristically, the Lomb-Scargle periodograms (up to convolution against a kernel determined by the temporal resolution of this diagram) may be recovered by simply integrating over time. However, for the horizontal band at 99 days, such an integral can be seen to be largely dominated by an episode of large photometric amplitude centred at around BTJD 1500, which, fortuitously, was covered contemporaneously by ASAS-SN g-band, TESS, and (at least at its beginning) ASAS-SN V-band. Prior to this episode, power can be seen to be exhibited at slightly longer rotational periods (in ASAS-SN V-band, shown in blue), while after it, power can be seen to be exhibited at slightly shorter rotational periods (from TESS, shown in red). Moreover, while this rotational peak is substantially less prominent in the ASAS-SN V-band periodogram compared to the others, our wavelet analysis reveals that this is because of time evolution: oscillatory variability at this period can be seen to emerge only after BTJD 700 or so, more than halfway through our temporal coverage in V-band. 

## Spectroscopy

\label{sec:spec}

To further test the interpretation of our quasiperiodic signal as being of rotational origin, we subject Zvrk to the LEOPARD two-component fitting procedure described in @cao_starspots_2022, applied to an APOGEE spectrum taken during a visit to Zvrk made at MJD 58886 = BTJD 1886, at a time where contemporaneous ASAS-SN g-band coverage indicates the persistence of the photometric modulation signal (vertical line in \cref{fig:photometry}a). The LEOPARD procedure returns a disk area coverage fraction of $f_\text{spot} = 0.02$, and a temperature contrast of $x_\text{spot} = T_\text{spot}/T_\text{surf} = 0.8$. Assuming that secondary component corresponds to a single large, morphologically concentrated, surface feature, its coverage fraction and intensity contrast are consistent with the observed, roughly $2\%$ photometric variability amplitude. However, the presence of only a single APOGEE visit prevents us from assessing properties of the evolution of these putative surface features.

Our initial selection of Zvrk was on the basis of a measurement of A(Li) = 3.36 dex --- almost meteoritic! \remarkJO{MARC: PLEASE PROVIDE MORE DESCRIPTION OF LITHIUM MEASUREMENTS HERE}. This lithium enrichment may be the result of highly efficient rotational mixing, of the kind thought to be potentially induced by tidal interactions with a close binary companion\remarkJO{MELINDA: FEEL FREE TO ELABORATE AS NECESSARY}. Unfortunately, since only one APOGEE visit to Zvrk was performed, we are unable to constrain the presence or absence of an unresolved companion from the time evolution of its radial velocities. However, Zvrk has a Gaia DR3 Renormalised Unit Weight Error (RUWE) of 1.056, close to unity, which indicates that such an unresolved companion, or at least one sufficiently massive as to result in photocentre jitter, is unlikely to be present [compared to a typically quoted threshold value of 1.4: @rizzuto_zodiacal_2018]. Zvrk is also not present in the RRRG catalogue of @patton_spectroscopic_2023, which identifies rapid rotators based primarily on their fitted temperatures being anomalously cool relative to the APOGEE DR16 catalogue. This indicates that, even if Zvrk's present rotational configuration should have been produced as a result of some kind of impulsive event causing it to puff up, such a structural perturbation should have thermally relaxed by now. Thus, at least Zvrk's structure, although probably not its evolutionary history, should be amenable to description by numerical stellar models in hydrostatic equilibrium.

In addition to the asteroseismic measurements that we have presented above, spectroscopic measurements of e.g. the stellar metallicity and effective temperature are also necessary as inputs into stellar modelling for more precise constraints on stellar properties. Such measurements for Zvrk already exist in the APOGEE DR17 catalogue [@apogeedr17, wherein it is found as 2MASS ID 05592585-5911542], with an effective temperature of $\teff = 4320 \pm 80\ \mathrm{K}$, and a metallicity of $\mathrm{[M/H]} = -0.21 \pm 0.08$ dex. Using this value of the effective temperature, in conjunction with the solar-calibrated scaling relation $\numax \sim g / \teff$, gives us $\log g_\text{seis} = 1.76 \pm 0.03$, which is significantly lower than the APOGEE DR17 value of $2.11$.  In principle, as is often done in other works combining asteroseismology with spectroscopy, we may employ our asteroseismic measurement of $\log g$ as a direct constraint on the surface gravity, and iterate between fitting for the remaining quantities with it held fixed, and refining asteroseismic $\log g$, until the fitted values converge. However, this iterative procedure is typically performed with far more precise constraints on $\numax$ than we have available here. Conversely, using our asteroseismic surface gravity here does not significantly modify the fitted temperature and metallicity. We therefore adopt the nominal APOGEE values for $\teff$ and metallicity, and their uncertainties, in our subsequent analysis. With these values of $\log g$, $\teff$, and the metallicity, we may then estimate a spectroscopic rotational broadening $V \sin i$ through the differential Doppler-broadening technique also used in @tayar_spinning_2022, which estimates the optimal amount of additional broadening required to reconcile a spectral template (given values of $\teff$, $\log g$, and abundances) compared with the observed APOGEE spectrum. From this, we obtain that $V \sin i = 10.1 \pm 0.7 \mathrm{km s^{-1}}$.

Given the global asteroseismic properties $\Dnu$ and $\numax$, and this spectroscopic effective temperature, we may apply the so-called "direct method", inverting their usual scaling relations [and including a structural correction factor $f_{\Dnu} = 0.97$ via the prescription of @sharma_stellar_2016] to obtain that $M = (1.181 \pm 0.15) M_\odot$, $R = (23.7 \pm 1.1) R_\odot$. This seismic mass estimate permits us to compare the chemical composition of Zvrk's convective envelope, and in particular its carbon-to-nitrogen ratio $[\mathrm{C/N}]= -0.08 \pm 0.017 \text{(stat)} \pm 0.057 \text{(sys)}$ from the APOGEE DR17 catalogue, with the mass-enrichment sequence of the APOKASC3 subsample of solar-like oscillators (Pinsonneault et al., in prep.) in the same catalogue. We show this comparison in \cref{fig:cn}, restricting this comparison to only first-ascent red giants, and to stars with with metallicities within 0.1 dex of Zvrk's. Since the sample is instrumentally and methodologically homogenous, it suffices for us to compare Zvrk against this reference population on only the basis of its statistical uncertainty.

A well-defined mass-enrichment sequence can be seen. Zvrk can be seen to lie above this enrichment sequence, given its seismic mass and relative abundances. We plot the location of Zvrk on this diagram using both its scaling-relation mass (blue), for an apples-to-apples comparison against the scaling-relation masses in the APOKASC3 catalogue, but also show its seismic mass constrained by detailed modelling against individual mode frequencies (orange), to indicate our actual precision of inference.\label{fig:cn}](CN.pdf)

In the background of \cref{fig:cn}, a clear mass-enrichment sequence can be seen, as marked out by the dark region of histogram bins. This sequence arises as a result of the strong sensitivity of the CNO cycle to the reaction temperature, combined with the tight dependence of the stellar central temperature, and of convective core sizes in stars possessing them, on the stellar mass. As a result of the former, a larger proportion of the main-sequence nuclear processing of hydrogen is performed through the CNO cycle in more massive stars, while as a result of the latter, a larger reservoir of hydrogen is available to predominantly CNO-cycle burning in more massive stars. At core hydrogen exhaustion, more massive stars will therefore have larger residual quantities of unreacted $^{14}\mathrm{N}$ (from the rate-limiting proton-capture reaction in the CNO cycle) present in their cores, which is then distributed into the envelope during first dredge-up. Correspondingly, we would expect --- within a limited range of metallicities, as we consider here --- that the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio [C/N] should be tightly, and negatively, correlated with the stellar mass.

Zvrk can be seen on \cref{fig:cn} to lie above this mass-enrichment sequence. While the uncertainties on the scaling-relation seismic mass are large enough to appear to permit consistency with it, we note that our seismic mass constrained by individual mode frequencies, which we describe in \autoref{sec:opt}, is significantly more precisly constrained. Were the systematic offsets between the detailed-modelling and scaling-relation seismic masses to be small, this would strongly disfavour a stellar mass low enough to permit Zvrk to lie on this sequence. Given the above discussion, this would in turn suggest that the material in Zvrk's convective envelope is less nuclear-processed than would be typical for an ordinary red giant of comparable mass and radius. However, our only avenue for an apples-to-apples comparison is through our unfortunately imprecise scaling-relation mass, since only scaling-relation and not detailed-modelling seismic masses are available (and for that matter, feasible) for all of the rest of the APOKASC3 catalogue. Hence, we are unable to definitively assess if Zvrk's departure from the enrichment-mass sequence is more than $1\sigma$-significant, as our scaling-relation mass would suggest.

<!--\remarkJO{$\left[\mathrm{^{12}C/^{13}C}\right]$ = $9.6 \pm 0.88$ from \cite{hayes_bacchus_2022}; JAMIE'S VALUE NOT IN TABLE}

From Chris Hayes:

It sounds like Jamie probably has one of the intermediate/internal versions we sent out before the final release, the one you can download from the SDSS VAC page is the final (and most correct one), and there were some slight changes to the analysis that we did, including adding a C12/C13 lower limit, which cleaned out some non-detections.

I unfortunately don’t have the old version of the data readily available to see why it made it through to abundances, but I did check the released version and the reason why this star is missing C12/C13 (and actually all of it’s abundances) is because we found that the star had a large convolutional velocity (CONVOL > 18 km/s).  This parameter is tied to physical values, but in a way that it could come from multiple different sources (instrumental broadening, rotational velocity of the star, macroturbulence velocity etc.), and this high of a value for giants suggests that either this star has a substantial rotational velocity (unusual for giants so the stellar parameters from APOGEE may be suspect because it didn’t include rotation for the giants) or that it had a large macroturbulent velocity (i.e., larger than assumed for giants by APOGEE – the only evolved stars that I know show this are massive supergiants).

I looked at the star’s spectrum and it does look like the lines in this star are broader than modeled by APOGEE, so it’s possible that the stellar parameters are a bit wrong, which could lead to systematically wrong abundances.  So I think it’s probably best not to trust the abundances for this star definitely from BAWLAS, since the features we were measuring were weak (and would be particularly sensitive to systematically wrong parameters), be you also might not want to put too much interpretive weight on the APOGEE abundances either.  They are probably ballpark okay, but there could be some systematics (which would also be more important for some of the weaker/more poorly measured APOGEE abundances).

Given this star’s magnitude and parallax from Gaia, I’m guessing this star is not a supergiant, which would probably suggest its broadening is from a large rotational velocity, so that would mean it would be a bit of a weird star.

# Asteroseismic Analysis

The uncertainties on the stellar mass and radius that we have derived from the direct method are large, both owing to the fact that $\numax$ is difficult to measure for evolved stars with comparatively few visible modes, as well as owing to the fact that the scaling relations themselves may not be reliable at advanced stages of evolution (whence the need for ad-hoc corrections like $f_{\Dnu}$ in the first place). However, these are still helpful in bounding the parameter space for further analysis. To refine our estimates of stellar properties, we turn to detailed modelling of stellar structure, as constrained by our measurements of individual mode frequencies. Having constrained Zvrk's structure, we will then examine the internal stratification of rotation in its envelope, by generalising existing rotational inversion techniques.

## Detailed Constraints on Stellar Properties and Structure

\label{sec:opt}

For the purposes of detailed seismic modelling, we rely on the implied $m = 0$ mode frequencies from the MCMC procedure that we described in \autoref{sec:mcmc}, which we list in full in \cref{tab:peakbag} in the appendix. Supplementing these mode frequencies are constraints on some global stellar properties, which we list in \cref{tab:t1}. Using these, we search for stellar models which match the global properties and individual mode frequencies by minimising the sum-of-squares discrepancy function, where for a given stellar model described by parameters $\theta$ we have
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
    \chi^2_\text{tot}(\theta) &= \left(\teff(\theta) - \teff_\text{obs} \over \sigma_\teff\right)^2  +\left({\mathrm{[M/H]}}(\theta) - {\mathrm{[M/H]}}_\text{obs} \over \sigma_{\mathrm{[M/H]}}\right)^2 \\
    &+\left(L(\theta) - L_\text{obs} \over \sigma_L\right)^2 + \chi^2_\text{seis}(\theta),\label{eq:chi2}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $\chi^2_\text{seis}$ is a cost function incorporating constraints from the individual mode frequencies. The precise form of it will depend on how we should choose to correct for systematic errors in the near-surface physics of our stellar models (the asteroseismic "surface term"). For this exercise, we tested both the parametric surface-term correction of @ball_correction_2014, and the nonparametric surface-insensitive penalty function of @roxburgh_asteroseismic_2016. We find, however, that our results do not change significantly between the two. To be conservative, we report results obtained with the latter, which provides slightly larger uncertainties [@ong_differential_2021].

Importantly, we note that neither $\Dnu$ nor $\numax$ enter directly into the constraints derived in this fashion: for this exercise, they affect only ancillary properties of our search for best-fitting parameters $\theta = (M, Y_0, Z_0, \amlt, t)$. In particular, we search for stellar models using the differential-evolution optimisation scheme, as implemented in @mier_yabox_2017, which requires us to supply bounds on our search space. Based on our scaling-relation estimate for the seismic mass, we restrict our attention to $M/M_\odot \in [1.05, 1.3]$; we also restrict our attention to stellar models within $\pm 25\%$ of our adopted value of \numax, as a proxy for evolution up the RGB. For the remainder of our parameters, we adopt fairly large bounds of $Y_0 \in [0.248, 0.32]$, $Z_0 \in [0.008, 0.02]$, and $\amlt \in [1.7, 2.1]$.

For each trial $\theta$, we generate an evolutionary track of stellar models using \mesa\ r12778, using the chemical mixture of @grevesse_standard_1998. Stellar models were generated without overshooting or mass loss, and with an Eddington-gray model atmosphere. While we include the effects of the diffusion and settling of helium and heavy elements, we vary the overall mixing coefficient as a function of stellar mass according to the prescription of @viani_investigating_2018, in order to smoothly disable it at masses substantially higher than 1.25 $M_\odot$. For models on each evolutionary track that lie within our permitted range of $\numax$ values, we compute the radial p-mode frequencies, and those of the nonradial $\pi$ modes as isolated using the prescription of @ong_semianalytic_2020, with the \gyre\ stellar oscillation solver. We then run 400 iterations of the differential evolution optimisation algorithm, retaining all stellar models generated along the optimisation trajectory.

From optimisation, we obtain a best-fitting point estimate of $\hat{\theta}_\text{MLE} = (1.18 M_\odot, 0.289, 0.0099, 1.863, 4.7\ \mathrm{Gyr})$. We will use this best-fitting model, and its associated evolutionary track, in our subsequent analysis requiring knowledge of Zvrk's temporal evolution or interior structure. More generally, in order to report uncertainties, we treat all of the models generated over the course of performing such optimisation as a set of nonuniform samples over our parameter space, $\Theta = \{\theta_i\} = \{(M_i, Y_{0,i}, Z_{0,i}, \amlt_i, t_i)\}$. Associated with this set of samples are the values of a likelihood function defined through \cref{eq:chi2} as $\mathcal{L}(\theta_i) = \exp[-\chi_\text{tot}^2(\theta_i)/2]$, evaluated for all $\theta_i \in \Theta$. If we were to compute likelihood-weighted averages and quantiles of stellar properties with respect to $\Theta$, as is often done with grid-based modelling [e.g. @cunha_plato_2021], we would effectively be providing Bayesian posterior estimates of these properties and their uncertainties, with the prior distribution determined by the sampling function over $\Theta$.

Such a procedure would yield estimates with respect to a uniform prior when used in grid-based modelling, where $\Theta$ is sampled uniformly (typically using a discretised coordinate mesh or Sobol sequence). In our case, however, the sampling over $\Theta$ is determined by our optimisation trajectory, which becomes increasingly densely sampled in the neighbourhood of the best-fitting point. Thus, a naive likelihood-weighted average would be prior-dominated in such a fashion as to both artificially select for the best-fitting result, and also systematically reduce the estimated uncertainties around it. Instead, it would be preferable for us to also return posterior estimates with respect to an uninformative, uniform prior over our input parameters, and to do this we must divide out the sampling function over $\Theta$. We estimate the sampling function $s(\theta)$ over $\Theta$ using a kernel density estimator, and compute weighted quantiles with respect to modified likelihood weights $w_i \propto \mathcal L(\theta_i) / s(\theta_i)$, with normalisation chosen to set $\sum_i w_i = 1$. We report the resulting posterior medians and $\pm 1\sigma$ quantiles for our input parameters, and Zvrk's radius, in \cref{tab:t2}. In addition, we provide values from a solar-calibrated model for comparison, where applicable. As we might expect, the stellar properties that emerge from our detailed modelling are far more precise than, although still consistent with, the rough estimates obtained from scaling relations. Given this constraint on the stellar radius, and using our posterior median estimate of the stellar inclination, our spectroscopic rotational broadening implies a surface rotation rate of $\Omega_\text{surf} / 2\pi = 0.099 \pm 0.007 \mu\text{Hz}$, which lies between the values that we obtain from the dipole and the quadrupole rotational splittings.

Finally, we consider systematic errors induced by variations on the techniques used for detailed modelling, which have been shown to be nontrivial for grid-based modelling of red giants [e.g. @campante_detailed_2023]. We conducted a separate optimisation-based modelling exercise, with stellar models generated using \mesa\ r15140, without diffusion and settling of helium and heavy elements, using a constant opacity in the atmosphere rather than the Eddington $T-\tau$ relation, and with the chemical mixture of @asplund_chemical_2009. The mass-loss prescription of @reimers_circumstellar_1975 was also used, with an efficiency parameter of $\eta = 0.1$. For this exercise, only radial mode frequencies were incorporated into the asteroseismic constraint; these were computed from stellar models using the `ADIPLS` oscillation solver, and included in the penalty function \cref{eq:chi2} through the surface-term correction of @ball_correction_2014. A search for the best-fitting parameters was conducted via the `astero` module of \mesa, using the Nelder-Meade optimisation scheme, and with uncertainties estimated using a local Jacobian matrix evaluated by finite differencing on a bounding simplex around the best-fitting sampled value. This second optimisation exercise yields an estimate for the initial mass of $1.142 \pm 0.050 M_\odot$ and a present mass of $1.138 \pm 0.050 M_\odot$, as well as an estimated radius of $23.44 \pm 0.11 R_\odot$; these are consistent with the values that we have reported in \cref{tab:t2}. Any systematic differences between the initial and final mass, as well as between these results and those reported in \cref{tab:t2}, are clearly dominated by the much larger statistical uncertainties. Since the values in \cref{tab:t2} include constraints from nonradial modes, we adopt them as our preferred values for subsequent analysis.

## Rotational Kernels

In principle, each observed rotational multiplet permits us to probe Zvrk's internal rotational profile $\Omega(r)$ with sensitivity to different parts of the stellar interior. In the perturbative regime of slow rotation, where $\Omega \ll 2\pi \Delta\nu$, the spacing between modes in a rotational multiplet is related to $\Omega(r)$ through an integral expression of the form [e.g. @gough_1981;@gough_rotation_1990]
\begin{equation}
    \omega_{n\ell m} - \omega_{n\ell 0}\equiv m \ \delta \omega_{n\ell}\sim m\beta_{n\ell} \int K_{n\ell}(r) \Omega(r) \mathrm d r ,\label{eq:rotintegral}
\end{equation}
where $\beta$ is an overall sensitivity constant, and $K$ is a normalised integral kernel, associated with a mode indexed by $n$ and $\ell$. For low-degree p-modes, $\beta \to 1$ in the limit of large $n_p$ and/or large $\ell$, while for g modes, $\beta \to 1 - 1/\ell(\ell + 1)$ in the same limit. If a large enough number of rotational multiplet splittings $\delta\omega_{n\ell}$ have been measured precisely, \cref{eq:rotintegral} may be inverted to yield inferences about the nature of the rotational profile.

There are two main classes of methods by which such "rotational inversions" have been performed in the asteroseismic literature, both inheriting in large part from similar efforts in helioseismology [e.g. @schunker_inversion_2016a;@schunker_inversion_2016b;@eggenberger_rotation_2019]. On one hand, we note that \cref{eq:rotintegral} is linear in $\Omega(r)$. In the method of optimally localised averages [OLA: e.g. @backus_resolving_1968], one may, in an ideal noise-free universe, choose judiciously some linear combination of $\beta_i K_i$ such that the coadded kernels approximate a $\delta$-function localised at some preselected location $r_0$, in which case the corresponding linear combination of $\delta\omega_i$ serves as an estimator for $\Omega(r_0)$. However, actually attaining a $\delta$-function kernel in this fashion requires both an infinite number of input modes, and also very large coefficients to be taken in the linear combination, which would result in very large uncertainties being placed on the inferred $\Omega(r_0)$. In practical settings, this linear combination is thus instead chosen to approximate an averaging kernel of finite width localised at $r_0$, with the shape of this kernel, and the quality of this approximation, being determined by some optimal compromise between spatial resolution and effective measurement uncertainty (e.g. MOLA: \citealt{gough_inverting_1985}; SOLA: \citealt{pijpers_sola_1994}). A full picture of $\Omega(r)$ is built up by repeating this procedure for various choices of $r_0$. By contrast, in the regularised least-squares (RLS) method [e.g. @jcd_comparison_1990], localisation is not performed directly. Instead, one first restricts description of $\Omega(r)$ to a sparse set of reduced dimensionality a priori, e.g. by parameterising it as a linear combination of basis indicator functions, or some combination of power laws and offsets. Given such a parameterisation, one may then use \cref{eq:rotintegral} to generate predictions for the multiplet rotational splittings. An optimal description of the rotational profile is then found by minimising the discrepancy between the predicted and measured rotational splittings, in a least-squares sense, with the potential inclusion of additional regularisation to penalise e.g. discontinuities and other pathological features in the inferred rotational profile.

There are two key differences between the observational situation for Zvrk, and previous applications of these rotational inversion techniques to red giant solar-like oscillations. The first relates to the nature of these inversion kernels. Rotational inversions in evolved stars have mostly been applied to dipole modes of mixed gravitoacoustic character. Morphologically, the rotational kernels of these mixed modes are combinations of g-mode components, which abruptly truncate at the radiative core boundary, and p-mode components, which sample the envelope and are insensitive to the radiative core. Such a combination has historically been described with a mixing fraction $\zeta$ in the form $\beta_{\text{mixed},n\ell}K_{\text{mixed},n\ell} = \zeta\beta_{\text{g},n\ell}K_{\text{g},n\ell}+(1-\zeta)\beta_{\text{p},n\ell}K_{\text{p},n\ell}$ [@goupil_seismic_2013]. However, since $\zeta$ is determined by the proximity of mixed modes to the underlying p- and g-modes as they undergo avoided crossings, small changes to the frequencies of these underlying modes may result in large changes to $\zeta$ --- particularly where the coupling strength between the mode cavities is weak --- for the most p-dominated mixed modes which are closest to these avoided crossings, and which are most amenable to observation. Equivalently, the radius of convergence for perturbative expansions for the rotating mode frequencies, of which linear expressions like \cref{eq:rotintegral} are but the first-order term, is significantly reduced for near-degeneracy configurations like those seen in red giants [@deheuvels_near_2017;@ong_rotation_1]. Any use of these mixed-mode kernels to perform inversions (not merely rotational) would accordingly be highly sensitive to small differences in the structure --- and thus, on the red giant branch, evolution --- of the reference models used to generate these kernels numerically, compared to that of the actual star. Obversely, the stellar structure would have to be constrained exquisitely well, both precisely and accurately, in order for inversions to be feasible with mixed modes.

Rotational inversions have never been attempted on red giants as evolved as Zvrk, since the coupling between its p- and g-mode cavities is exceedingly weak. Ordinarily, this would render its mixed-mode kernels pathologically sensitive to $\zeta$. However, since this coupling is so weak as to be observationally irrelevant, we may apply new methodological developments to perform such inversions with respect to notional pure p-modes instead. Having isolated the p-mode cavity through the $\pi$-mode construction of @ong_semianalytic_2020 in our optimisation exercise, we now compute its rotational kernels using $\pi$-mode eigenfunctions, as described in @ong_rotation_1. In order for such pure p-mode kernels to be used in inversion problems for subgiants and less evolved red giants, the notional "pure" p-mode rotational splittings must be determined from a set of mixed modes. In general, this remains an open problem. Fortunately, the observational irrelevance of any coupling to the g-mode cavity works in our favour here, as we already have effectively measured the p-mode rotational splittings directly, rendering the problem moot.

Freed of any dependence on the g-mode cavity, the pure p-mode rotational kernels turn out to be extremely robust to even large variations in structure and evolution. We show in \cref{fig:kernels} how they evolve over a very large range of $\numax$ --- from double to half of our nominal observed value --- over the course of the best-fitting evolutionary track from our optimisation exercise. Specifically, we show in \cref{fig:kernels}a the evolution of a representative rotational kernel --- that associated with the $n_p = 6, \ell = 1$ mode --- plotted as a function of fractional radius. The overall morphology and normalisation of this kernel, as well as the locations of null sensitivity, can be seen to remain extremely stable despite the very large range of \numax\ considered here. This is as opposed to the behaviour of mixed-mode kernels, where relative fractional sensitivity to the core, which is determined by $\zeta$, would vary rapidly over time, as p-modes evolve onto and off resonance with the underlying g-modes. Likewise, the overall normalisations $\beta$ are also very stable (\cref{fig:kernels}b), changing by no more than 1\% over a large range of $\numax$. Again, this is stark contrast with mixed modes, whose overall normalisations $\beta \sim \zeta \beta_g + (1-\zeta) \beta_p$ would switch between 1 and $1-1/\ell(\ell + 1)$ as modes evolve through avoided crossings. Thus, despite the TESS data having constrained Zvrk's structure in \autoref{sec:opt} with somewhat less precision than has traditionally been possible with *Kepler*, we can be reasonably confident that our subsequent attempts at inspecting its rotational stratification using p-mode kernels will remain robust against potential systematic misestimates of its interior structure, unlike the conventional situation with mixed-mode kernels.

The morphology of the kernel shown in \cref{fig:kernels}a is typical of the pure p-mode rotational kernels encountered in helioseismology, and in the asteroseismology of main-sequence stars. Its sensitivity can be seen to be concentrated towards the surface, as are its zero points. Thus, if we were to place uninformative priors on the localisation of rotational shear, such priors cannot be uniform in the physical radial coordinate, but must rather be proportional to the apparent envelope, and density of zeros, of these kernels. To ease our subsequent analysis, we will find it beneficial to reparameterise these kernels into a radial coordinate system such that uninformative priors are also uniform in our preferred radial coordinate. For this purpose, we choose to use the acoustic radius, $t(r) = \int_0^r (1/c_s)\mathrm{d}r$, as our preferred radial coordinate [as originally proposed in @pijpers_sola_1994]. The p-mode displacement eigenfunctions are known to admit an approximate description in terms of Riccati-Bessel functions of the first kind[^bessel], $s_\ell$ [see e.g. @roxburgh_asteroseismology_2010;@lindsay_near_2023]:
\begin{equation}
     \psi_r \equiv r\sqrt{\rho c_s} \xi_r \sim s_\ell(\omega t + \delta_\ell),\label{eq:bessel}
\end{equation}
where $c_s$ is the sound speed, and $\delta_\ell$ is an inner phase function with only weak dependence on frequency and position away from $t = 0$ and $t = T$. Since the p-mode eigenfunctions are orthogonal with respect to the integral measure $r^2 \rho$ when integrated with respect to the physical radial coordinate, the scaled wavefunctions $\psi$ form an orthogonal basis with respect to the unit measure when integrated with respect to the acoustic radial coordinate. Thus, we may treat a uniform prior on the acoustic radius as being uninformative. Under the action of such reparameterisation, the kernels themselves transform as $K_t(t) = c_s K_r(r(t))$. We show the $n_p = 6, \ell = 1$ kernel under the action of this reparameterisation in \cref{fig:kernels}c, plotting the kernels now as functions of the fractional acoustic radius. Again, we see that any variations to the shape and the loci of sensitivity arising from structural evolution are slight. Away from the boundaries set by the centre and the surface of the star, the shape of the kernels is roughly sinusoidal; this is because the Riccati-Bessel functions appearing in \cref{eq:bessel} may be approximated as sinusoids at large argument [@arfken_weber_2005], so this is a property of p-modes generally, and not just this mode in particular. For illustration, we also show a similar diagram for the $n_p = 6, \ell = 2$ p-mode in \cref{fig:kernels}d, which exhibits much the same qualitative insensitivity to evolution.

[^bessel]: These are related to the usual spherical Bessel functions of the first kind as $s_\ell(x) = x j_\ell(x)$. Here we use lowercase $s$ rather than the more conventional uppercase to avoid confusion with the Lamb frequency, which is also written as $S_\ell$ in the context of asteroseismology.

A further consequence of our use of pure p-mode rotational kernels is that, as can be seen in \cref{fig:kernels}, the nonradial p-mode wavefunctions decay to zero at small radius, and so these kernels are almost entirely insensitive to the radiative core (whose boundary is situated in our best-fitting stellar structure at $r/R \sim 0.03$). For rotational inferences made using mixed modes, it is common to parameterise radial differential rotation in terms of a phenomenological two-zone model, with the core and envelope treated as separately rotating solid bodies [e.g. @klion_diagnostic_2017;@triana_internal_2017;@mosser_period_2018;@gehan_core_2018;@eggenberger_asteroseismology_2019;@fellay_asteroseismology_2021;@ahlborn_improved_2022]. By contrast, any constraints on radial differential rotation that we might obtain using our observed p-modes, through these p-mode rotational kernels, will be localised entirely within the convective envelope.

## Radial Differential Rotation

\label{sec:inversion}

Our posterior distributions for the averaged dipole and quadrupole rotational splittings, \autoref{sec:mcmc}, are statistically distinct, which suggests that Zvrk's envelope is not rotating as a solid body, and likely exhibits radial differential rotation. Given the preceding discussion, we might wish to investigate this differential rotation using existing rotational inversion techniques. However, our attempts to do so are hindered by the second main point of departure between Zvrk and existing rotational inversions, being that its asteroseismic observations were obtained from TESS, while most existing rotational inversions have only been attempted on solar or *Kepler* data. Limitations of the TESS data set --- including its poorer photometric stability, redder bandpass, and presently shorter duration compared to the nominal *Kepler* mission --- resulted in us having to pool measurements of the rotational splitting width between different modes in \autoref{sec:mcmc}. While we also tried constraining these multiplet widths for each mode individually, the resulting uncertainties on the multiplet splittings turned out to be too large for the rotational inversion techniques that we have described above to be feasibly prosecuted. To proceed further, we must adapt both methods to this present situation where we have only indirect access to the individual multiplet splittings, $\delta\omega_{n\ell}$.

    \label{fig:shear}
\end{figure*}

We first consider how the OLA method may be adapted to operate with respect to our pooled rotational measurements. We observe that the pooled rotational splitting for dipole modes must be related to those of the underlying individual dipole multiplets through some kind of visibility-weighted averaging procedure, not necessarily linear. If we approximate this with a linear combination of mode-wise rotational splittings as $\delta\omega_{\ell = 1}\sim \sum_{n,\ell = 1} w_n \delta\omega_{n,\ell}$, then the corresponding linear combination of dipole-mode kernels effectively provides us with a "pooled" sensitivity kernel, $K_{\text{eff}, 1}$, for the observed dipole rotational splitting. We may also divide the averaged splitting by the associated linear combination of sensitivity constants, $\left<\beta_1\right> = \sum_{n,\ell=1} w_n \beta_{n\ell}$, to yield an estimate of $\Omega(t_1)$ as localised by this pooled kernel. Such an estimate is localised, roughly speaking, at the centre of sensitivity for this pooled kernel, $t_1 = \int t \cdot K_{\text{eff}, 1}(t)\ \mathrm{d}t$. Since we have two averaged rotational splittings at our disposal --- one for dipole modes, and one for quadrupole modes --- we in principle then should be able to constrain rotational shear in terms of the differences in localised rotation rates, $\Delta\Omega \sim \Omega(t_2) - \Omega(t_1)$, as well as differences in the locations at which these estimates are made, $\Delta t = t_2 - t_1$.

It remains for us to determine how these coefficients $w_i$ are to be related to the mode visibilities. By ansatz, we set $w_i \propto H_i$, the observed mode heights appearing in \cref{eq:model}. Through the above discussion, we may then evaluate $\Delta\Omega$, $\Delta t$, and the per-degree pooled kernels in closed form, given values for all of the nonradial mode heights and averaged rotational splittings. Since our nested-sampling procedure in \autoref{sec:mcmc} provides us with a large number of samples from the joint distributions between all of these quantities, applying this procedure to all of these samples permits us to estimate the entire posterior distributions for $\Delta\Omega$, $\Delta t$, and the pooled kernels themselves, constrained directly by the power spectrum.

We examine these posterior distributions in \cref{fig:shear}. In \cref{fig:shear}a, we show the marginal distributions for $\Delta\Omega$ (top) and $\Delta t$ (bottom), in both cases marking out 0 with a dashed line, which is the value demanded by a null hypothesis of solid-body rotation. We find that $p(\Delta\Omega > 0) \gtrsim 0.85$, strongly suggesting that rotational shear is indeed present, although unfortunately we are not able to rule out the null hypothesis altogether. Since we have defined $\Delta t$ in the sense $t_2 - t_1$, rudimentary JWKB analysis would suggest that it be positive, as the inner turning points of the quadrupole p-modes, set by where the Lamb frequency $S_\ell = \sqrt{\ell(\ell+1)} c_s/r$ matches the mode frequency $\omega$, lies outside of that of the dipole modes. Contrary to this expectation, the posterior distribution for $\Delta t$ is more consistent instead with negative values. This would indicate that the inner portions of the convective envelope are rotating more quickly than the outer portions; in order to match the significantly faster surface rotation rate, this picture of rotational stratification would require a second shear layer to be located almost at the surface.

We examine these kernels in more detail in \cref{fig:shear}b, where we plot with the faint thin curves 100 samples from the posterior distribution over both pooled kernels, and with the thick solid curves the posterior median pooled kernels, using different colours for each degree. Additionally, we mark out the location of the JWKB inner turning points (evaluated at $\numax$) from our best-fitting model with vertical dashed lines, in matching colours. The quadrupole inner turning point can indeed be seen to lie exterior to the dipole inner turning point. However, the shape of the quadrupole-mode pooled kernel can also be seen to be more spread out than the dipole-mode kernel. Ultimately, this is because the expressions for the rotational kernels contain explicit dependence on $\ell$ through contributions from a term $[\ell(\ell + 1) - 1]\xi_h^2$, in addition to the implicit dependences of the eigenfunctions themselves on $\ell$. For low-degree p-modes, the displacement eigenfunctions become approximately radial in the outer parts of the star, where the approximation of plane-parallel stratification holds well. Thus, this degree-dependent enhancement to the rotational kernel from the horizontal component of the eigenfunction is most significant near the interior of the star. Accordingly, the quadrupole-mode kernels feature a "leg" protruding inwards from their first local maximum after the inner turning point, which is not present in the dipole-mode kernels. This has the effect of rendering the quadrupole-mode kernels more spread out compared to the dipole mode kernels, and of moving their centres of sensitivity inwards (shown with the dotted vertical lines). For Zvrk in particular, this adjustment to the centre of sensitivity is comparable to, and slightly larger than, the differences in the inner turning points. In any case, any differences in the locations of the centres of sensitivities are minute compared to both the spread implied by the posterior distribution on $\Delta t$, and the localisation widths of the pooled kernels themselves (indicated with the horizontal intervals). Thus, without access to the individual rotational splittings, our constrained modification to the OLA techique is unfortunately unable to pin down the location, or even direction, of the implied rotational shear in the envelope.

    \label{fig:rls}
\end{figure*}

The preceding discussion has implicitly relied on a two-zone model of radial differential rotation, where we have used the separation between pooled dipole and quadrupole modes to provide us both the averaged rotation rate in these two zones, as well as the locations of the zones themselves. Since the underlying rotational kernels have proven uncooperative in allowing us to distinguish the locations of these two zones, we may instead make this assumption explicit by parameterising $\Omega(t)$ to contain two physically separated regions of solid-body rotation, with a shear layer between the two. More concretely, we describe the rotational profile as
\begin{equation}
    \Omega(t; \Omega_\text{in}, \Omega_\text{out},t_\text{shear},\Delta t) = \Omega_\text{in} + \left(\Omega_\text{out} - \Omega_\text{in} \over 2\right)\left(\tanh\left(t - t_\text{shear}\over \Delta t\right) + 1\right),\label{eq:shear}
\end{equation}
which we use to generate predictions for the rotational splittings through \cref{eq:rotintegral}, as done in the RLS technique. Rather than comparing these predictions against measured rotational splittings (which we do not have in hand), we may instead constrain the parameters $(\Omega_\text{in}, \Omega_\text{out},t_\text{shear},\Delta t)$ of this description directly against the power spectrum, by inserting these predictions into our parametric model of the power spectrum, \cref{eq:model}, in lieu of the pooled rotational splittings, and evaluating likelihoods using the same $\chi^2$-2-degree-of-freedom likelihood function (\cref{eq:lnlike2dof}) as we had earlier used for the pooled rotational splittings. This allows us to derive posterior distributions for these parameters of \cref{eq:shear} (and the other existing parameters of the model) through the same nested sampling procedure as we had used in \autoref{sec:mcmc}. For this purpose, we place the same uniform priors on $\Omega_\text{bulk} = (\Omega_\text{in} + \Omega_\text{out})/2$ as we did on the pooled rotational splittings in \autoref{sec:mcmc} (up to factor of $2\pi$), and we also place very wide uniform priors on $\Delta\Omega = \Omega_\text{out} - \Omega_\text{in}$, permitting it to vary between $-0.016\ \mu$Hz and $+0.016\ \mu$Hz --- i.e. our prior is chosen explicitly so as not to favour either sense of the rotational shear.

We show the resulting joint posterior distribution for these parameters, together with the inclination, using blue points, contours, and histograms, in \cref{fig:rls}a. As we encountered in our earlier discussion of the rotational kernels, even this regularised construction is unable to constrain the location, or the sharpness, of the rotational shear. However, as above, it appears to also weakly favour a sense of the rotational shear where the interior of the convective envelope is rotating faster than the exterior. To better illustrate this, we show in \cref{fig:rls}b several random samples for the posterior distribution over possible shapes of $\Omega(r)$, using the thin faint curves. These curves are coloured blue if $\Omega_\text{in}>\Omega_\text{out}$, and red otherwise. The overall median rotational profile, which we show with the solid black curve, is such that the rotation rate decreases outwards. Nonetheless, we cannot rule out the opposite sense of differential rotation, as some rotational profiles in the converse sense (i.e. increasing outwards, shown in red) are encompassed within the $1\sigma$-credible region, shown with the dashed black curves.

As we have discussed earlier, differential rotation in the sense of $\Omega$ decreasing outwards would possibly require a second shear layer to exist near the the surface, not described by \cref{eq:shear}, for consistency with the photometric rotation rate. This shear layer would also have to be located very near the surface, in order not to overly affect values returned from the integral expression in \cref{eq:rotintegral} from the low-degree kernels that we have access to. Such an asteroseismically inaccessible (at least at low degree) near-surface shear layer is not strictly speaking impossible. Indeed, it is the preferred explanation adopted by @tayar_spinning_2022 to explain the rotational configuration of the red giant considered in that work, whose surface rotation rate, obtained from spectroscopy, is similarly faster than a pooled estimate of bulk rotation in the envelope recovered from the quadrupole and octupole p-modes. A near-surface shear layer (albeit with rotational shear in the opposite sense) is also known to exist in the Sun, where its presence is confirmed by the observational availability of intermediate and high-degree modes, whose rotational kernels, being confined almost entirely to the near-surface layers, would not find it similarly invisible [e.g. @schou_helioseismic_1998;@howe_rotation_2009].

However, without measurements of modes of intermediate or high degree available, we cannot claim that this explanation is unique. For one, should the surface features producing this rotational signal be spots located at high latitude, and should Zvrk exhibit latitudinal differential rotation in an anti-solar sense, then we would expect its equator to be rotating more slowly than the photometric modulations would imply. Since the spherical harmonics of the sectoral modes through which we observe the rotational splitting are sensitive mostly to an equatorial band [i.e. $P_\ell^\ell(\cos \theta)$ can be expressed in terms of only $\sin \theta$: @arfken_weber_2005], this might suffice to explain such a discrepancy from purely geometrical considerations. However, this explanation would be a very ad-hoc resolution to our problem: each of these assumptions would itself be a significant departure from how we understand stars to work, and we would require both to be satisfied.

We can also explore alternative solutions to this issue by further regularising our asteroseismic inferences. To demonstrate this, we repeat our nested-sampling exercise, but further demand that $\Omega_\text{out}$ match our photometric surface rotational period of 99 days (i.e. we place a $\delta$-function prior on $\Omega_\text{out}$). We place a uniform prior on $\Omega_\text{in}$ centered on this value, extending $0.016\ \mu$Hz in both directions --- again, so as not to favour either sense of the rotational shear a priori. In this fashion, we recover a conditional posterior distribution for the scenario where the outer rotation rate of the convective envelope matches the surface; should a near-surface shear layer exist, we ought to see them emerging as samples from our posterior distribution. We show the results of this procedure in \cref{fig:rls}a using the orange points, contours, and histograms.

Under this more restrictive scenario, the inferred conditional posterior distribution on $\Omega_\text{in}$ can now be seen to very strongly favour differential rotation in the sense of $\Omega$ increasing outwards. This can also be seen when we examine the implied conditional distribution over the rotational profiles themselves, shown in \cref{fig:rls}c, where sampled profiles which increase outwards are shown in orange, and those which do not are shown in gray: the latter can be seen to be exceedingly rare. However, we see also that the imposition of this hard prior on  $\Omega_\text{out}$ also requires $t_\text{shear}$ to be situated much farther away from the surface, as can be seen from the strong peak in its marginal distribution in \cref{fig:rls}a, at roughly $t/T \sim 0.1$ (i.e. $r/R \sim 0.3$ in our best-fitting stellar structure), as opposed to being near the surface as we originally posited. This does not, however, contraindicate the existence of such a near-surface shear layer, as we have little a priori justification for adopting such a $\delta$-function prior on $\Omega_\text{out}$ in the first place.

# Discussion

## Rotation

We show a summary of our consolidated constraints on Zvrk's rotational configuration in \cref{fig:rotsummary}. The purely asteroseismic constraints that we have derived in \autoref{sec:inversion} are shown in blue and orange, while our two measurements of the surface rotation rate --- from photometric modulations, and from combining Doppler line broadening with our asteroseismic inclination and model radius --- are shown in gray. As far as radial differential rotation is concerned, we may conclude from the available asteroseismic data only that (1) rotational shear is most likely present in Zvrk's convective envelope, but (2) both senses of rotational shear, in bulk, are permitted by such constraints as we are able to produce. (3) In both cases, however, there must exist some location in Zvrk such that the local rotational gradient is in the sense of $\Omega$ increasing outwards. If the bulk shear is such that $\Omega$ decreases outwards, then a secondary, very thin, shear layer must exist near Zvrk's surface to produce consistency with the observed photometric rotation rate. If the bulk shear is such that $\Omega$ increases outwards, this may happen over longer length scales, and be situated closer to the interior. 

![Summary of various rotational measurements. Median rotational profiles from both of our regularised exercises in \cref{fig:rls} are shown with the solid lines, and their credible regions with the filled areas. The rotation rates from the pooled localisation kernels, and their localisation widths, are indicated with the two coloured data points. Our two estimates of the surface rotation rate (from photometry, and by combining spectroscopic $V\sin i$ with asteroseismic inclination and a radius from stellar modelling) are indicated with the gray data points.\label{fig:rotsummary}](rot_summary.pdf)

While both of our direct measurements for the surface rotation rate sit slightly higher than our unconstrained regularised predictions for the surface rotation rate from asteroseismology (blue shaded region), we note that the discrepancy between the two direct measurements is greater than between either of the two and our asteroseismic prediction. As we have discussed earlier, an ad-hoc combination of anti-solar latitudinal differential rotation and high-latitude spotting could bring the equatorial surface rotation rate implied by photometry into agreement with our asteroseismic measurements of the bulk rotation rate in the envelope. Conversely, in the more likely scenario of low-latitude features and solar-like latitudinal differential rotation, our photometric value would be more representative of an equatorial rotation rate than the value produced by Doppler line-broadening.

Our somewhat loose constraints on Zvrk's rotational stratification have unfortunate implications for ongoing attempts to make similar measurements for less evolved red giants. As we have discussed, disentangling p-mode rotation rates from the observed mixed modes in these red giants remains an open problem. Nonetheless, our results suggest that even if this methodological barrier were to be surmounted, one would still need both more precise constraints on the multiplet rotational splittings, and more available multiplets with precisely measurable rotational splittings, than we have at our disposal here, in order to place well-defined constraints on envelope rotational shear.

## Formation and Mass Constraints

We identify three different classes of explanations for how Zvrk's rotational and chemical configuration came to be, which would roughly yield both a high rotation rate, and an enhanced lithium abundance:

(I)  Mass transfer from a hitherto undetected stellar companion would yield enhanced lithium at Zvrk's surface. In this scenario, its high rate of rotation could be attributed to either direct deposition of angular momentum from the accreted material, or tidal spin-up as a result of binary interactions. Such spin-up might also induce rotational mixing, thereby bringing lithium into the envelope through self-pollution.
(II)  Alternatively, both the enhanced lithium abundance and high rate of rotation could be attributed to Zvrk having engulfed at least one formerly orbiting companion [e.g. @stephan_eating_2020;@oconnor_giant_2023], with both matter and angular momentum being directly deposited into its envelope, and being redistributed over the course of several mixing timescales.
(III)  Finally, for the sake of argument, Zvrk could represent significant departures from the existing theory of single-star evolution. To match the chemical enhancements and fast rotation rate, its evolution would necessitate an efficiency of chemical mixing and angular momentum transport far in excess of that currently assumed of red giants.

No WISE infrared excess.

Given present angular momentum content, lower limit of 11 MJup for eccentric orbit and 16 MJup for circular orbit. Absolute upper limit of 80 MJup if accreted at MS radius. Even this highly massive engulfment mass would yield an enhancement in lithium of at most 2.24 dex, which is still more than an order of magnitude less than that observed here.

## Magnetic Activity

Magnetic activity in dwarfs is known to be generated by rotational shear, which can be characterised by the Rossby number $\mathrm{Ro} = P_\text{rot} / \tau_\mathrm{cz}$. Customarily, the convective turnover timescale $\tau_\mathrm{cz}$ is evaluated in Sun-like main-sequence stellar models locally --- e.g. at one pressure scale height $H_p$ above the base of the convection zone, near the tachocline. However, since red giants are almost entirely convective by spatial extent, such a local definition is not necessarily representative of Zvrk in particular. Moreover, while the base of the convection zone is colocated with the tachocline in Sun-like stars, our analysis in \autoref{sec:inversion} does not yield well-defined constraints on the location of Zvrk's rotational shear. As such, we evaluate the Rossby number with respect to a global convective turnover timescale instead:
\begin{equation}
    \tau_\mathrm{cz} = \int_{r_1}^{r_2} {\mathrm d r \over V_\text{conv}},
\end{equation}
where $r_1 = r_\text{base} + H_p$ and $r_2 = r_\text{top} - H_p$, and $V_\text{conv}$ is the convective velocity (which we compute from mixing-length theory). This is a similar construction to that also used for fully convective dwarfs, which likewise do not possess a well-defined tachocline. Evaluating this quantity with respect to the best-fitting model in our optimisation exercise in \autoref{sec:opt}, in conjunction with our nominal photometric rotational period, gives us $\mathrm{Ro}_\star \sim 0.28$. By contrast, computing this quantity from a solar-calibrated MESA model with the same physics yields $\mathrm{Ro}_\odot = 1.38$. Roughly speaking, the solar Rossby number is known to fluctuate between 1/2 and 2 over the course of the solar activity cycle, with lower values achieved closer to solar maximum. 

On one hand, the convective turnover timescale that we have obtained, $\sim 350$ days, is comparable to the timescales over which the amplitude of the photometric variability presented in \autoref{sec:photometry} appears to evolve, and so we cannot rule out a convective origin for the surface features producing this signal. However, our subsolar model value of the Rossby number generated using this same timescale also indicates that Zvrk is possibly magnetically active, which is consistent with an interpretation of this variability as being that of surface magnetic features, potentially spots, rotating into and out of view on the visible disk.

Aside from spotting, any putative surface magnetism is known to express itself on active dwarfs in the time domain, in the form of flares and eruptive outbursts. Were it to be magnetically active, it is possible that Zvrk also participates in such transient events. Unfortunately, since Zvrk is a quite evolved (and therefore luminous) red giant, such transients would have to be very energetic indeed, in order to be observable despite dilution from Zvrk's high baseline luminosity. Nonetheless, the fortuitious availability of TESS data at 2 minute cadence affords us far better temporal resolution than conventionally available for red giants, and has permitted us to identify at least one possible marginal detection of a flare in Zvrk's PDCSAP lightcurve (shown in \cref{fig:flare} at BTJD 2250.7, along with samples from the posterior distribution of fits to it of an impulse-exponential-decay model). Should flares actually occur on Zvrk, we should also expect to see occasional outbursts of energetic photons. Indeed, we find that near-UV photons have historically been detected from Zvrk's sky position in archival GALEX data [@gphoton]. We defer a more detailed investigation of this possible magnetic activity to a future work.

\end{figure}

While rapid for a red giant, Zvrk's surface rotation remains far slower than its breakup rotation rate, $\Omega_\text{crit} = \sqrt{GM/R^3}$. From our seismic constraints on Zvrk's mass and radius, we find $T_\text{crit} = 2\pi/\Omega_\text{crit} \sim 12.5\ \mathrm{d}$. However, both Zvrk's rotational period and this critical rotation rate would have changed significantly over the course of its evolution up the red giant branch. In particular, if we are to interpret the apparent photometric variability as spot modulations, the same magnetic field that drives this spot activity, and the possible flaring that we discuss above, ought also to be responsible for magnetic rotational braking. In the absence of further deviations from single-star evolution, we therefore would expect Zvrk to have been rotating more quickly earlier on the red giant branch. While the breakup rotation rate $\Omega_\text{crit}$ should also have been faster at earlier times, its changes are a result of structural expansion, which operate on longer timescales than magnetic braking.

We show in \cref{fig:braking}a different predictions and retrodictions for Zvrk's rotational evolution, based on different possible scenarios for such magnetic braking along the evolutionary track producing our best-fitting model in the optimisation exercise of \autoref{sec:opt}. Solutions are tuned to yield a rotational period of 100 d at the best-fitting stellar model, indicated with the vertical dotted line; we plot the surface rotation rate $\Omega$ as a fraction of the breakup rotation rate $\Omega_\text{crit}$. We show with the dashed curve an unphysical, counterfactual scenario with no magnetic braking. Under this extremely permissive scenario, Zvrk must have been rotating at more than half the breakup rotation rate on the main sequence. Such a high rotation rate would, in an actual star, almost surely induce magnetic braking. In turn, the action of any magnetic braking whatsoever would require Zvrk to initially have been rotating still faster, in order to match its present observed rotational period on the red giant branch. 

In \cref{fig:braking}a, we also consider retrodictions generated using the magnetic braking prescription of @matt_magnetic_2012, where the rate of angular momentum loss, $\dot{J}$, scales with either $\Omega$ or $\Omega^3$, depending on whether or not the inverse Rossby number exceeds a saturation threshhold (with saturation achieved when $\Omega \tau_\text{cz} > \omega_\text{crit} \tau_{\text{cz},\odot}$). For this exercise, we adopt a standard value for the saturation rotation rate of $\omega_\text{crit} \sim 12\Omega_\odot$, and a normalisation constant for the angular momentum loss rate of $f_K = 9.37$, calibrated to produce the solar equatorial rotation rate of 25.4 d for our solar-calibrated MESA model with a disk rotation period of 8 d and a disk-locking timescale of 1 Myr. This setup is generally in keeping with previous uses of this angular-momentum-loss prescription. The initial conditions of our integration are again chosen to produce a rotational period of 100 d at the present observed value of \numax. We show these retrodictions (integrating backwards in time) and predictions (integrating forwards), with the solid curve, coloured according to lookback time $\Delta t = t_\text{present} - t$, in the sense of larger values being earlier in time.

Fortuitously, our chosen combination of solar-calibrated $f_K$, $\omega_\text{crit}$, and $\tau_\text{cz}$ are such that Zvrk enters the saturated regime very shortly before the present day in our retrodictions. Zvrk experiences unsaturated braking ($\dot{J} \propto \Omega^3$) in most of its preceding evolution up the RGB. Under this scenario, $\Omega$ increases very rapidly with lookback time. In order to produce its present rotation rate in the presence of magnetic braking, Zvrk must have been rotating at or faster than the breakup rotation rate $\Omega_\text{crit}$ within about 5 Mya, when it was already a quite evolved red giant ($\numax < 20\ \mu\mathrm{Hz}$), which is absolutely incompatible with any hypothesis of its angular momentum having been of intrinsic origin. Thus, the action of magnetic braking both rules out a single-star origin hypothesis for Zvrk's rotational configuration, and places an upper limit on how long ago any engulfment event could have occurred.

This same magnetic braking would also place an upper limit on how long we would expect such a rotational signal to persist after the initial deposition of angular momentum into Zvrk's envelope. We show a comparison of the timescales in \cref{fig:braking}b. The spindown timescale owing to structural expansion in the absence of magnetic braking, $|P_\text{rot} / \dot{P}_\text{rot}|$, shown with the blue curve, can be seen to be much slower than the magnetic braking timescale $|J_\text{tot} / \dot{J}_\text{tot}|$, shown in orange. For the latter, the solid curve shows the scenario depicted in \cref{fig:braking}a, where Zvrk's magnetic braking saturates shortly before the present day. We also consider a more pessimistic scenario, where we extrapolate from its present rotational configuration under the assumption that the magnetic braking remains unsaturated, shown with the dotted curves on both \cref{fig:braking}a and b. However, even this aggressive braking scenario can still be seen to yield braking timescales far longer than the Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale, shown in gray, which we use as a proxy for the thermal readjustment timescale. This is significant because any engulfment hypothesis for the deposition of angular momentum into a red giant's envelope would also necessitate heating the envelope, causing the red giant to puff up in response, and resulting in anomalously cool observed temperatures (as predicted in \citealt{oconnor_giant_2023} and \citealt{yarza_hydrodynamics_2023}, and reported in \citealt{patton_spectroscopic_2023}). Since thermal readjustment can be seen to occur over much shorter timescales than even aggressive rotational braking, our observational determination of Zvrk as being both rapidly rotating, and yet not too spectroscopically unusual, appears compatible with an engulfment hypothesis.

# Conclusion

We have determined that TIC\ 350842552, or "Zvrk" for short, is a rapidly-rotating first-ascent red giant. We have measured Zvrk's rotation rate with independent uses of asteroseismology, photometry (from space and from the ground), and spectroscopy (from rotational Doppler broadening). Our constraints on Zvrk's global properties and structure, derived from detailed asteroseismic modelling against constraints from individual mode frequencies, suggest that all of these rotational measurements are mutually consistent with each other. We have further developed, and then employed, new techniques in asteroseismic rotational analysis --- making use of recent theoretical developments permitting pure p-modes to be disentangled from the usual spectrum of mixed modes --- to constrain properties of Zvrk's radial differential rotation independently of the radiative core. Together, these paint a picture of Zvrk as being differentially rotating in its envelope, and possessing rotational shear in the sense of the rotation rate increasing outwards at some point: a similar configuration to that proposed for a far less evolved red giant in @tayar_spinning_2022.

Aside from this anomalous rotation, we have additionally found Zvrk's envelope to be simultaneously almost meteoritic in its lithium enrichment, and also potentially less enriched in $^{14}\mathrm{N}$ than typical for its mass. An intrinsic origin for the observed lithium and angular momentum, with both having been brought up from the fast-rotating and nuclear-enriched core, would either require nitrogen to be somehow destroyed in the envelope or transported selectively in the opposite direction, or else is not incompatible with the (admittedly weakly constrained) deviation from the nitrogen enrichment sequence. Conversely, an extrinsic hypothesis for our derived rotational configuration, with angular momentum deposited into the envelope by either the accretion of infalling material or the engulfment of a less massive object, would also produce chemical pollution in a sense compatible with both of these observational signatures. The lack of any discernible infrared excess causes us to favour an engulfment rather than accretion scenario. Further astrophysical constraints from magnetic braking then place limits on how long ago such an engulfment could have occurred --- no more than several million years ago. With such a recent engulfment, Zvrk's angular momentum content suggests a mass for the engulfed object of roughly 15 $M_J$. However, its extremely high lithium enrichment is hard to explain without any kind of self-pollution having also occurred, which in turn would be difficult to reconcile with its apparent position relative to the nitrogen enrichment sequence without resorting to fine-tuning a combination of the two hypotheses.

Our discovery of Zvrk raises further, more general, questions regarding the nature and frequency of such possible engulfment events, and of the polluted stars that are left behind. The large engulfment mass of 15 $M_J$ that we have derived would require either that systems like Zvrk are exceedingly rare, or that similarly massive companions to low-mass stars are more common than the present observational scarcity of brown dwarfs at small orbital radii [e.g. @grether_dry_2006] would lead us to believe. Astrophysically, it is not yet well understood how efficiently such massive objects would be disrupted were they actually to be deposited into a red giant envelope; unfortunately, our poor constraints on the structure of Zvrk's rotational shear do not better illuminate this. However, the new asteroseismic tools that we have developed here, and used on Zvrk, might also be applied to other known lithium-anomalous post-main-sequence stars, many of whose rotational properties are currently even more poorly constrained. More generally, a better understanding of such engulfment events may help to explain the origins of the current, known, population of standalone rapidly-rotating red giants with no detectable companions. Some of these rotating red giants are also known to be magnetically active [e.g. @gehan_surface_2022], and the potential links between this magnetic activity and stellar rotation may also be worth further investigation.

As for Zvrk itself, much remains about it to be observationally determined. Between our initial asteroseismic detection and the writing of this paper, a few extra months of a third year of TESS CVZ coverage, in Cycle 5, have been collected. We have found the addition of a few months not to provide any noticeable differences to any of our asteroseismic constraints. However, given the proposed longevity of the TESS mission (potentially decades as advertised), long-term monitoring might yield qualitative improvements in the quality of such additional asteroseismic constraints as we might eventually be able to derive. Should it actually be flaring, Zvrk would make a compelling target for future space-based UV photometry missions. Finally, although the Gaia RUWE is not consistent with a wide-separated binary companion, our single radial velocity measurement cannot definitively rule out the presence of a very close orbital companion. Zvrk's southerly location renders it amenable to contemporaneous follow-up radial-velocity observations for this purpose using cutting-edge instruments, such as ESPRESSO (for now) and G-CLEF (in the near future). All of these paths lead far beyond the scope of this paper, but there is clearly much more work to be done.

# Peakbagged Mode Frequencies

For the purposes of stellar modelling, we assume that all rotational splittings are symmetric (i.e. no perturbations to the mode frequencies arising from latitudinal differential rotation or magnetic fields), and use the notional $m = 0$ mode frequencies associated with our parametric model, \cref{eq:model}, as constraints on the $m = 0$ mode frequencies returned from MESA stellar models. We provide our fitted values of these mode frequencies in \cref{tab:peakbag}. For each mode, we report a posterior median and the size of the 1-$\sigma$ credible region around this median, computed from the marginal posterior distribution for its nonrotating frequency. We also provide our identification of the degree $\ell$, and of the p-mode radial order $n_p$, supplied through the asymptotic relation, \cref{eq:asymptotic}.
